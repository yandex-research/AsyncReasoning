# AsyncReasoning


## How to run eval demo:
(The idea is to unify requirements for both hogwild and tts)
1. Update env with newer `./requirements.txt`
2. Install speech-rule-engine (node package) current directory (`.`):
```
npm init -y
npm install speech-rule-engine
```
3. Rune `demo_eval.ipynb`

Please make sure that it works for you!
